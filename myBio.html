         <p>I grew up in Chesterfield, VA right outside of Richmond.  I've loved art for as long as I can remember, painting in particular.
            I followed that path up until college when I enrolled in VCU's School of Art. After about a year of that torture I decided to move on and spent a year taking various classes without aim.
            Eventualy, I earned a place in the biomedical engineering program and graduated with my bachelors several years later. Still unable to figure out what to do with myself I decided to get my masters degree.
            I heard of a program through The da Vinci Center at VCU which endeavored to harness the power of crossfunctional teams. After successfully completing that degree I was no closer to figuring out what to do with my life.
            Logically, I quit my partime job, adopted a puppy and drove cross-country (stories to come later). Once I got back to Richmond I realized the severity of the financial situation I had created for myself. 
            My student loans were about to come into repayment; enter Bank of America. I've been at the bank since Nov 2016 and I'm trying desperately to escape. That is why I'm super excited to have found this bootcamp, I'm very much looking forward to learning and launching a new career.
